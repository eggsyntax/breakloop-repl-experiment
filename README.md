# breakloop-repl

Ultimately a failed proof-of-concept; I only had a bit of time to spend on it. It may be impossible to have a true Common-Lisp style breakloop in Clojure due to lack of continuations on the JVM ([Project Loom](https://cr.openjdk.java.net/~rpressler/loom/Loom-Proposal.html) may solve this at some point).
